-How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in 
 Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?
  
  -By designing and using a CRUD Python module effectively, where i was able to not only use the same code but also updated it and accomodate it for prject two or other work.
 
-How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous 
 assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

 -I'd say mainly by trial and error, also looking up the errors received and trying to figure out the correct approach to get past them. At my job we use huge databsases for all the investment accounting data and    even though I am not in charge of managing or creating databases, this course was helpful to understand the magnitude of code the developers must handle to maintain and use those databases. 

-What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

 -Besides developing all of the code, they implement the requirements from the client into 'life' and allow the user to handle their data and processes as required.
